	They say it should be the best year ever
	
	It was probably my most frustrating year ever
	
	But in hindsight, like always, frustrating leads to the best things in life




Ironically an mba taught me how to search for happiness rather than for money


Omdat ik niet 
	- Corporate ben geworden
	- Vc funded entrepreneur ben geworden 
En terug engineer wil worden (om dan weliswaar entrepreneur te worden)!
