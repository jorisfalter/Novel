the only purpose of this one is to do a commit in the busy days of moving from phuket 

thursday evening. everything is packed. tomorrow we leave at 5.30am to hkt airport to catch the 9.05 qatar flight 

with 85kgs of luggage, 2 kids, 1 cat and a 4 hour layover

friday morning: checking in the cat went smooth but took long. also because we had a baby without passport stamp

saturday evening, we arrived but jetlag is a bitch. 7pm, time for bed

tuesday evening, still quite tired
