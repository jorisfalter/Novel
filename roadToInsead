I had INSEAD

The road to INSEAD
	After I left university, I did a job in a chemicals plant. It was nice because chemicals plants are freaking interesting. But boring in the way of working. Showing up every day at 9, leaving at 5.
	Doing basically nothing. 
	
	I felt mediocre
	
	After 2 years, I started dreaming of the MBA again. 
	
	I didn't know anyone who did it. I started learning from the internet. From the FT, from job fairs. 
	
	I started picking mediocre schools, because I felt mediocre. And I thought all schools were kinda the same
	
	And then someone told me I should visit the schools.
	
	So I went to Rotterdam, number 33, to INSEAD, number 5, to Berlin, unlisted, to 
	
	And the gap between number 5 and number 33 was massive. 
	
	Number 33 had frustrated people, no goals, no inspiration
	
	Number 5 was as if all fun, inspirational people in the world came together

A piece of luck

	A fistel 
	
	Ik heb mijn mba en dus mijn leven deels te danken aan een fistel
