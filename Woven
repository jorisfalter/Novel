the end 

early march 2024 i went to japan to run tokyo marathon 


When I was in Japan I noticed everything was cheap. Ramen soup in a restaurant was 6 euros, a metro ticket 2 euros.

For my freelance contract I was paid in USD.

To extent my freelance contract I was asked to reduce my rate with around 20%.

i was supposed to fly back sunday night to kl, work from there in the morning, and continue my journey to phuket during my lunch break (i always liked working from odd places, similarly when i had to work from phuket to charter a sailing boat, and for that i had fo catch a 6am flight and subsequntly try to find an open coffee bar)

However that Monday, in an unexpected meeting, the dots were connected between cheap soup, and my freelance work for Toyota Japan, when I was informed that despite reducing my rates, I ended up being more expensive.

The Japanese Yen vs USD exchange rate crashed. Soup is cheap, but foreign employees were expensive.
