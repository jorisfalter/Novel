 I wasted my high school


I'll blame my older brother. 
I'll make it up later in this story

He put a strong negativity in me
He was against everything
And being the younger sibling, I copied his behaviour

And thus for most of my high school and university, I was grumpy
I was against everything

In high school, I was the rotten apple in the class, according to the English teacher.
I think our personalities didn't match from the start

It didn't get better because off my behaviour

The biggest problem with being against everything, is that you become like the people arguing with strangers on the internet 10 years later
By being against everything, I didn't contribute, 
And if you don't contribute, I didn't add value. Not to the world
But most off all, not to myself. 

I didn't learn to take initiative, with friends, with girls, ... I was always waiting for others to take the lead.

I could have spend my youth 
	- Learning to program
	- Reading books of role models
	- Dating a lot more girls
	- Doing sports 
	- Going backpacking
	- ...

I did have these sparks of energy and inspiration:
	- I remember wanting to switch schools because I wanted something new. 
	- I switched universities because I was bored and frustrated
		○ Being against everything, I never learned confidence, I never learned how to have a conversation
	- I remember being super enthusiastic about building stuff at university, but I couldn't manage to convince people
		○ With the ornithopter
		○ With some idea I had with Benjamin

I was smart, but I wasn't ambitions, that's were role models came in
