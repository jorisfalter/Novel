## Novel

Documents and stories I intend to use to write a novel one day

Written direclty in Github, not in Visual Studio

## 
goal is a romanticized biography like Arnold Schwarzenegger's Total Recall or Richard Branson's Losing my Virginity 

alternatively, a more commercially oriented title like
- four hour work week
- subtle art of not giving a fuck
- what they teach you at hbs
- ...

which are also biographies to a certain extent, but for which the title made the difference (like ali abdaal said in the mfm podcast)

## sources todo 
- my story up to now
- ...
