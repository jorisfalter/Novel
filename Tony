High energy people like Tony Robbins had a high influence on my life 

though it took a while before i realised that 

i remember listening to the Tim Ferriss podcast when i finished my MBA and commuted to my consulting assignment in Mechelen, between Brussels and Antwerp.

i found an interview with Tony and Tim and i would listen it over and over again 

my consulting assignment wasnt going great and this was a way to get myself pumped up for the day 

from there i started following and learning more, reading his books and watching his online seminars 


it was his extremely high energy which attracted me, though it took me until a toastmasters speech somewhere in 2022 or 2023 that i realised that style resonated with me because it was the natural stule at which i operated myself as well
