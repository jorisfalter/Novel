I have always been eager to build all kinds of things from a young age
Ever since I was a child, I loved designing, and building things.
It started at young age, with empty boxes building fortresses and lego building massive constructions.

I didn't like to do it according to the book, building new things was way more fun.
At later age, this became bigger tools, trying to build my first attempt to build a fitness machine at age 16 (failed unfortunately)

At university, we build model airplanes, my mantra was always SIMPLICITY. Like Einstein said, everything should be as simple as possible, but not simpler.

In the meantime, I was designing and selling an Olympic white water course in my hometown, together with the Flemish Canoe Union. The government sponsored the project with 1 million euro.

Kayak was a big hobby, so i designed a wooden ramp four metres high. With an insane team of people, we built it in less than a month.

While in Bangkok, I designed an outside shower, and a bar / diner table overlooking the city.
To have my room dark when I sleep, and light when I wake up, I also automated my curtains .
As an entrepreneur I experimented with food products. Doing the design was great, keeping fresh produce fresh a massive challenge.
