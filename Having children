having children is the most impactful thing you'll ever do.

and yet people don't like to talk about it

i can write a long article about the little day to day joys of having children and you would get bored. it would be the least popular chapter.

i think that is because the joys are hard to describe to someone who hasnt experienced them 

similar to the love you get from your spouse, people dont brag about that to their friends either (at least men dont)

or from the million funny things your dog does during the day 

somehow its very hard to share these experiences

maybe its hard to share emotion and experiences overall

its hard to share the feeling of excitement when giving a speech for an audience 
its hard to explain to a friend the adrenaline rush when doing white water kayaking

maybe love is the hardest emotion to explain to someone else 

hence why we dont talk about the joys of children
